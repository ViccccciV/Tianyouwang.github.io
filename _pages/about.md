My name is Tianyou Wang,a Master student majoring in Robotics（你专业全称看看有没有问题） at the University of Pennsylvania. Having majored in intelligent manufacturing and robotics, I have always been passionate about exploring cutting-edge issues in the field of robotics. My fascination with 3D computer vision and robot learning grew during my master’s study at the GRASP Laboratory, where I contributed to the ZeroMimic project under Prof. DineshJayaraman’s guidance. My research （research interest你看看对不对）  spans various innovative projects, including robotic policy generalization and applied robotics for real-world tasks. Recently,I'm developing a project focus on Metric-Scale Human Hand Grasp Generation from Single-View Input for Robotic Manipulation.

**Research Experience**
======

Metric-Scale Human Hand Grasp Generation from Single-View Input
------
1.3D Hand Generation: Building diffusion-based grasp generation model from in-the-wild human videos.

ZeroMimic: Distilling Robotic Manipulation Skills from Web Videos
------
1.3D Reconstruction and Data Processing:  Extracted human wrist trajectories grounded in world 3D coordinates by reconstructing the hand pose and the egocentric cameras. Processed human data for ACT and Diffusion Policy training, ensuring data quality and model training effectiveness.

2.ZeroMimic System Construction: Designed Human Affordance-based Grasping built on VRB and AnyGrasp for the
grasping module in the system. Took part in implementing the wrist trajectory policy in the DROID robot setting for the post-grasp module in the system.

3.Policy Evaluation: Processed both robot data and human data and established evaluation methods to assess zero-shot policy performance in diverse everyday environments. Performed experiments on 9 skill policies using a Franka Emika Panda Arm in 3 diverse environments and showed that ZeroMimic achieves 67.9% out-of-the-box success rate.

Novel Environment Generalization of Action-Chunking Transformer Visuomotor Policy
------
1. Model Construction: Modified the Action-Chunking Transformer by replacing original image feature embeddings with pre-trained observation-to-state mappings, creating the GDN-ACT model.
   
2.Experiment Demonstration: Demonstrated the construction and training process of the GDN network, verifying its
generalization capability and applicability in 6 new environments.

Trajectory Planning and Closed-loop Control for a Subway Seat Cleaning Robot Manipulator
------
1.Impedance Control: Implemented an impedance control algorithm, ensuring the roller end-effector accurately tracked seat contours in real-time and applied the necessary force for consistent cleaning results.

2.Simulation: Conducted simulations using ROS and Gazebo to test and verify the control algorithm's effectiveness.
